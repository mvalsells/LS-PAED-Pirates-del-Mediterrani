Projecte 2n Semestre - Programació avançada i estructura de dades, Curs 2020-21 

## Description
This is my 1st project working with different data structures, it was developed by me and my colleagues Alba Martín, Aitor Arceda and Roger Torras.

The following data structures were implemented by ourselves:
- Graphs
- Binary trees
- R trees with graphical representation (I think this one never worked correctly)
- Tables / HashMap

**Note:** Some XXL dataset have been removed since they are over 100MB
